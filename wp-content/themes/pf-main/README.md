# PublicFunction WordPress Starter Theme #

 - Version 2.0.1
 
### WordPress starter theme built by PublicFunction ###

This theme is meant to be used in conjuction with the [PublicFunction Parent Theme](https://github.com/mattras82/pf-parent-theme) and refactored with the branding of the site it is being used on. This is merely a jumping off point.

Happy Coding!
